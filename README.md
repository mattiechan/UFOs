# UFO Sightings: Fact of Fancy?

## Overview of Project

This analysis was a starting point to gain an understanding of the JavaScript journey by looking into its technical aspects and how it applies to the field of data analytics and visualization. For this analysis, I will be helping Dana, a data journalist who is writing about her hometown, McMinnville, Oregon. McMinnville is known for its sightings of UFOs. Dana only has a HTML file containing information on UFO sightings and want to set up a web page containing her article, along with the data to support her findings. Multiple filters are also considered when creating this web page to fine tune her results. 

## Results

First, we have provided the user with search filters to sift through the data. They can search by typing in the data they are looking for by the following filters: data, city, state, country and shape. This will allow for more granular findings.

Here is an example of a search using the 'city' filter, searching for events that happened in Aspen. We are shown the date it occured, the location we filtered by, and all the other corresponding information pertaining to events that occured in our search of UFO sightings that occured in Aspen.

## Summary

Although this is a great first step in making the data more accessible to others and helps Dana in supporting her findings for her article, there are definite improvements that can be implemented to make this webpage more dynamic and user friendly. The current setup of the web page does not allow for varying formatting of the data that is shown within the table. The following is an example of the same search we did above but with proper capitalizatio of the city "Aspen".

As you can see, no results show as a result of different capitalization in the search filter. 
Another improvement we can implement is to widen the scope of the 'date' fitler. We can expand it to a range of dates rather than show events per day. It would be more accessible and can be shown a wider range of data at a glance.
