# UFO Sightings: Fact of Fancy?

## Overview of Project

This analysis was a starting point to gain an understanding of the JavaScript journey by looking into its technical aspects and how it applies to the field of data analytics and visualization. For this analysis, I will be helping Dana, a data journalist who is writing about her hometown, McMinnville, Oregon. McMinnville is known for its sightings of UFOs. Dana only has a HTML file containing information on UFO sightings and want to set up a web page containing her article, along with the data to support her findings. Multiple filters are also considered when creating this web page to fine tune her results. 

## Results

First, we have provided the user with search filters to sift through the data. They can search by typing in the data they are looking for by the following filters: data, city, state, country and shape. This will allow for more granular findings.
